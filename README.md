- `git clone <url>`: download the repo from the web to your computer
    - make sure you are not in another repo
    - just like `git init` do only one per repo

## Branches

- `git branch <branch_name>`: creates a new branch where you are
- `git switch <branch_name>`: moves to the branch
    - `git checkout <branch_name>`: the "older" way
